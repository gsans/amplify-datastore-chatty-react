## Pre-requisites

- Node: `13.12.0`. Visit [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
- npm: `6.14.4`. Packaged with Node otherwise run upgrade

```bash
npm install -g npm
```

## Getting Started - Creating the React Application

To get started, we first need to create a new React project & change into the new directory using the [Create React App CLI](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you already have this installed, skip to the next step. If not, either install the CLI & create the app or create a new app using npx:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app amplify-datastore
```

Or use npx to create a new app:

```bash
npx create-react-app amplify-datastore
```

Now change into the new app directory & install the AWS Amplify & AWS Amplify React libraries:

```bash
cd amplify-datastore
npm install --save aws-amplify aws-amplify-react
```

> If you have issues related to EACCESS try using sudo: `sudo npm <command>`.

## Installing the CLI & Initializing a new AWS Amplify Project

### Installing the CLI

Next, we'll install the AWS Amplify CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

Now we need to configure the CLI with our credentials:

```js
amplify configure
```

> If you'd like to see a video walkthrough of this configuration process, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWbM5DLh25U).

Here we'll walk through the `amplify configure` setup. Once you've signed in to the AWS console, continue:
- Specify the AWS Region: __eu-west-2 (London)__
- Specify the username of the new IAM user: __amplify-workshop-user__
> In the AWS Console, click __Next: Permissions__, __Next: Tags__, __Next: Review__, & __Create User__ to create the new IAM user. Then, return to the command line & press Enter.
- Enter the access key of the newly created user:   
  accessKeyId: __(<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>)__   
  secretAccessKey:  __(<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>)__
- Profile Name: __amplify-workshop-user__

### Initializing A New Project

```bash
amplify init
```

- Enter a name for the project: __amplifydatastore__
- Enter a name for the environment: __dev__
- Choose your default editor: __Visual Studio Code (or your default editor)__   
- Please choose the type of app that you're building __javascript__   
- What javascript framework are you using __react__   
- Source Directory Path: __src__   
- Distribution Directory Path: __build__   
- Build Command: __npm run-script build__   
- Start Command: __npm run-script start__   
- Do you want to use an AWS profile? __Y__
- Please choose the profile you want to use: __amplify-workshop-user__

Now, the AWS Amplify CLI has iniatilized a new project and you will see a new folder: __amplify__ and a new file called `aws-exports.js` in the __src__ directory. The files in this folder hold your project configuration.

```bash
<amplify-app>
    |_ amplify
      |_ .config
      |_ #current-cloud-backend
      |_ backend
      team-provider-info.json
```


## Adding Authentication

To add authentication, we can use the following command:

```sh
amplify add auth
```
> When prompted choose 
- Do you want to use default authentication and security configuration?: __Default configuration__
- How do you want users to be able to sign in when using your Cognito User Pool?: __Username__
- Do you want to configure advanced settings? __Yes, I want to make some additional changes.__
- What attributes are required for signing up? (Press &lt;space&gt; to select, &lt;a&gt; to 
toggle all, &lt;i&gt; to invert selection): __Email__
- Do you want to enable any of the following capabilities? (Press &lt;space&gt; to select, &lt;a&gt; to toggle all, &lt;i&gt; to invert selection): __None__

> To select none just press `Enter` in the last option.

Now, we'll run the push command and the cloud resources will be created in our AWS account.

```bash
amplify push
```

To quickly check your newly created __Cognito User Pool__ you can run

```bash
amplify status
```

> To access the __AWS Cognito Console__ at any time, go to the dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/). Also be sure that your region is set correctly.

### Configuring the React application

Now, our resources are created & we can start using them!

The first thing we need to do is to configure our React application to be aware of our new AWS Amplify project. We can do this by referencing the auto-generated `aws-exports.js` file that is now in our src folder.

To configure the app, open __src/index.js__ and add the following code below the last import:

```js
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'
import config from './aws-exports'
Amplify.configure(config)
```

Now, our app is ready to start using our AWS services.

### Using the withAuthenticator component

To add authentication, we'll go into __src/App.js__ and first import the `withAuthenticator` HOC (Higher Order Component) from `aws-amplify-react`:

### src/App.js

```js
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react'
```

Next, we'll wrap our default export (the App component) with the `withAuthenticator` HOC:

```js
export default withAuthenticator(App, { includeGreetings: true })
```

```sh
# run the app

npm start
```

Now, we can run the app and see that an Authentication flow has been added in front of our App component. This flow gives users the ability to sign up & sign in.

> To view the new user that was created in Cognito, go back to the dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/). Also be sure that your region is set correctly.

### Accessing User Data

We can access the user's info now that they are signed in by calling `Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()`.

### src/App.js

```js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify'

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()
      .then(user => console.log({ user }))
      .catch(error => console.log({ error }))
  })
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>
        Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Adding a GraphQL API

To add a GraphQL API, we can use the following command:

```sh
amplify add api
```

Answer the following questions

- Please select from one of the above mentioned services __GraphQL__   
- Provide API name: __Chatty__   
- Choose an authorization type for the API __API key__   
- Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? __N__   
- Do you want a guided schema creation? __Y__   
- What best describes your project: __Single object with fields (e.g. “Todo” with ID, name, description)__   
- Do you want to edit the schema now? (Y/n) __Y__   

> When prompted, update the schema to the following:   

```graphql
type Coin @model {
  id: ID!
  clientId: ID
  name: String!
  symbol: String!
  price: Float!
}
```

> Next, let's push the configuration to our account:

```bash
amplify push
```

- Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API __Y__
- Choose the code generation language target: __javascript__
- Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions: __(src/graphql/**/*.js)__
- Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions? __Y__
- Enter maximum statement depth [increase from default if your schema is deeply nested] __2__

To view the service you can run the `console` command the feature you'd like to view:

```sh
amplify console api
```

### Adding mutations from within the AWS AppSync Console

In the AWS AppSync console, open your API & then click on Queries.

Execute the following mutation to create a new coin in the API:

```graphql
mutation createCoin {
  createCoin(input: {
    name: "Bitcoin"
    symbol: "BTC"
    price: 9000
  }) {
    id name symbol price
  }
}
```

Now, let's query for the coin:

```graphql
query listCoins {
  listCoins {
    items {
      id
      name
      symbol
      price
    }
  }
}
```

We can even add search / filter capabilities when querying:

```graphql
query listCoins {
  listCoins(filter: {
    price: {
      gt: 2000
    }
  }) {
    items {
      id
      name
      symbol
      price
    }
  }
}
```

### Interacting with the GraphQL API from our client application - Querying for data

Now that the GraphQL API is created we can begin interacting with it!

The first thing we'll do is perform a query to fetch data from our API.

To do so, we need to define the query, execute the query, store the data in our state, then list the items in our UI.

### src/App.js

```js
// src/App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

// imports from Amplify library
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify'
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react'

// import query
import { listCoins } from './graphql/queries'

function App() {
  const [coins, updateCoins] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    getData()
  }, [])

  async function getData() {
    try {
      const coinData = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(listCoins))
      console.log('data from API: ', coinData)
      updateCoins(coinData.data.listCoins.items)
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('error fetching data..', err)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {
        coins.map((c, i) => (
          <div key={i}>
            <h2>{c.name}</h2>
            <h4>{c.symbol}</h4>
            <p>{c.price}</p>
          </div>
        ))
      }
    </div>
  )
}

export default withAuthenticator(App, { includeGreetings: true })
```

## Performing mutations

 Now, let's look at how we can create mutations. Let's change the component to use a `useReducer` hook.

```js
// src/App.js
import React, { useEffect, useReducer } from 'react'
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify'
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react'
import { listCoins } from './graphql/queries'
import { createCoin as CreateCoin } from './graphql/mutations'

// import uuid to create a unique client ID
import uuid from 'uuid/v4'

const CLIENT_ID = uuid()

// create initial state
const initialState = {
  name: '', price: '', symbol: '', coins: []
}

// create reducer to update state
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'SETCOINS':
      return { ...state, coins: action.coins }
    case 'SETINPUT':
      return { ...state, [action.key]: action.value }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  useEffect(() => {
    getData()
  }, [])

  async function getData() {
    try {
      const coinData = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(listCoins))
      console.log('data from API: ', coinData)
      dispatch({ type: 'SETCOINS', coins: coinData.data.listCoins.items})
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('error fetching data..', err)
    }
  }

  async function createCoin() {
    const { name, price, symbol } = state
    if (name === '' || price === '' || symbol === '') return
    const coin = {
      name, price: parseFloat(price), symbol, clientId: CLIENT_ID
    }
    const coins = [...state.coins, coin]
    dispatch({ type: 'SETCOINS', coins })
    console.log('coin:', coin)
    
    try {
      await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(CreateCoin, { input: coin }))
      console.log('item created!')
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('error creating coin...', err)
    }
  }

  // change state then user types into input
  function onChange(e) {
    dispatch({ type: 'SETINPUT', key: e.target.name, value: e.target.value })
  }

  // add UI with event handlers to manage user input
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        name='name'
        placeholder='name'
        onChange={onChange}
        value={state.name}
      />
      <input
        name='price'
        placeholder='price'
        onChange={onChange}
        value={state.price}
      />
      <input
        name='symbol'
        placeholder='symbol'
        onChange={onChange}
        value={state.symbol}
      />
      <button onClick={createCoin}>Create Coin</button>
      {
        state.coins.map((c, i) => (
          <div key={i}>
            <h2>{c.name}</h2>
            <h4>{c.symbol}</h4>
            <p>{c.price}</p>
          </div>
        ))
      }
    </div>
  )
}

export default withAuthenticator(App, { includeGreetings: true })
```

### GraphQL Subscriptions

Next, let's see how we can create a subscription to subscribe to changes of data in our API.

To do so, we need to define the subscription, listen for the subscription, & update the state whenever a new piece of data comes in through the subscription.

```js
// import the subscription
import { onCreateCoin } from './graphql/subscriptions'

// update reducer
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'SETCOINS':
      return { ...state, coins: action.coins }
    case 'SETINPUT':
      return { ...state, [action.key]: action.value }
    // new �
    case 'ADDCOIN':
      return { ...state, coins: [...state.coins, action.coin] }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// subscribe in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = API.graphql(graphqlOperation(onCreateCoin)).subscribe({
      next: (eventData) => {
        const coin = eventData.value.data.onCreateCoin
        if (coin.clientId === CLIENT_ID) return
        dispatch({ type: 'ADDCOIN', coin  })
      }
  })
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
}, [])
```


## Deploying via the Amplify Console

For hosting, we can use the [Amplify Console](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/) to deploy the application.

The first thing we need to do is [create a new GitHub repo](https://github.com/new) for this project. Once we've created the repo, we'll copy the URL for the project to the clipboard & initialize git in our local project:

```sh
git init

git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git

git add .

git commit -m 'initial commit'

git push origin master
```

Next we'll visit the Amplify Console in our AWS account at [https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home).

Here, we'll click __Get Started__ to create a new deployment. Next, authorize Github as the repository service.

Next, we'll choose the new repository & branch for the project we just created & click __Next__.

In the next screen, we'll create a new role & use this role to allow the Amplify Console to deploy these resources & click __Next__.

Finally, we can click __Save and Deploy__ to deploy our application!

Now, we can push updates to Master to update our application.

## React Native

AWS Amplify also has framework support for [React Native](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/start?platform=react-native).

To get started with using AWS Amplify with React Native, we'll need to install the __AWS Amplify React Native__ package & then link the dependencies.

```sh
npm install aws-amplify-react-native

# If using Expo, you do not need to link these two libraries as they are both part of the Expo SDK.
react-native link amazon-cognito-identity-js
react-native link react-native-vector-icons
```

Implementing features with AWS Amplify in React Native is the same as the features implemented in the other steps of this workshop. The only difference is that you will be working with React Native primitives vs HTML elements.

## Removing Services

If at any time, or at the end of this workshop, you would like to delete a service from your project & your account, you can do this by running the `amplify remove` command:

```sh
amplify remove auth

amplify push
```

If you are unsure of what services you have enabled at any time, you can run the `amplify status` command:

```sh
amplify status
```

`amplify status` will give you the list of resources that are currently enabled in your app.

## Deleting entire project

```sh
amplify delete
```
